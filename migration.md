This document outlines the changes made to update the medic/pyxform fork to match the latest XLSForm/pyxform while preserving CHT-specific functionality.

## Overview

The Community Health Toolkit (CHT) uses ODK forms to capture input data from users for various configurable workflows. Pyxform is used to transform ODK form configurations from the .xlsx format into the .xml configuration interpreted by the CHT server. The current implementation uses a forked version of pyxform (medic/pyxform) that has fallen behind the original repository (XLSForm/pyxform) and is missing many fixes and improvements.

This project aims to update the medic/pyxform codebase to incorporate the latest features from XLSForm/pyxform while maintaining backward compatibility with CHT-specific customizations.

## Phase 1: Core Implementation (Current PR)

This PR focuses on the most critical feature identified in the issue description: **deterministic ordering of XML attributes**. It also verifies that key CHT-specific customizations are preserved.

### 1. Deterministic Ordering of XML Attributes

**Problem Addressed:**
Currently, regenerating a form XML that has not changed can still result in significant diffs since the ordering of attributes in the XML elements is not deterministic and their order can change (even if the content of the xlsx file stayed the same).

**What Changed:**

- Modified the `node()` function in `utils.py` to use `sorted(kwargs.items())` instead of the default iteration
- This ensures that XML attributes are consistently ordered alphabetically, regardless of the order they appear in the code

**Benefits:**

- More predictable and consistent XML generation
- Easier version control and diff comparison
- Reduced noise in form updates
- Simplified testing and validation of forms

**Implementation Details:**

- The change is implemented in `pyxform/utils.py` in the `node()` function
- Added a test file `tests/test_deterministic_ordering.py` to verify consistent attribute ordering
- The test creates nodes with identical attributes in different orders and verifies the resulting XML is identical

**Code Change:**

```python
# Before:
for k, v in kwargs.items():
    # ...

# After:
for k, v in sorted(kwargs.items()):
    # ...
```

### 2. Custom Question Types (Verification)

**What's Verified:**

- All CHT-specific question types are maintained:
  - `db:person`
  - `db:clinic`
  - `db:health_center`
  - `db:district_hospital`
  - `tel`

**Implementation Details:**

- These custom types are defined in `pyxform/question_type_dictionary.py`
- Added a test file `tests/test_custom_question_types.py` to verify these types work correctly
- The test creates form elements with each custom type and verifies they are properly represented in the generated XML

### 3. Meta Section Handling (Verification)

**What's Verified:**

- Special handling for meta sections with `tag="hidden"` attribute
- This ensures proper display and processing of meta sections in CHT applications

**Implementation Details:**

- This functionality is implemented in `pyxform/section.py`
- Added a test file `tests/test_meta_section.py` to verify meta sections have the `tag="hidden"` attribute
- The test creates a survey with a meta section and verifies the generated XML includes the tag="hidden" attribute

## Future Phases

The following features will be implemented in future PRs:

### 1. Instance Tag Values Copying

- Allow instance tag values to be copied properly
- Modify tag attribute handling in `utils.py`
- Create tests to verify instance tag values are copied correctly

### 2. Language Tag Format

- Support simplified language tag format (e.g., `label::en`)
- Add configuration option for language tag format
- Create tests to verify both formats work correctly

### 3. Empty Label Handling

- Implement custom handling for empty labels
- Ensure consistent display in CHT applications
- Create tests to verify empty labels are handled correctly

## Migration Notes

### For Form Developers

- No changes are needed for existing forms
- The deterministic ordering of XML attributes is transparent to form developers
- All CHT-specific question types continue to work as before

### For Application Developers

- The updated pyxform should be a drop-in replacement for the current version
- No changes to application code should be needed
- The deterministic ordering of XML attributes may affect how diffs appear in version control, but in a positive way (more consistent)

## Testing

The following tests have been added to verify the implemented features:

1. `tests/test_deterministic_ordering.py` - Verifies consistent attribute ordering
2. `tests/test_custom_question_types.py` - Verifies CHT-specific question types
3. `tests/test_meta_section.py` - Verifies meta section handling

To run the tests:

```bash
python -m unittest discover
```

## Known Issues

- Some tests may fail due to ODK Validate issues
- These failures are not related to the implemented features and will be addressed in future PRs

## Relationship to Original Issue

This PR addresses the most important change identified in the original issue:

> DETERMINISTIC ORDERING OF XML ATTRIBUTES
> This is the most important change as currently, regenerating a form xml that has not changed can still result in a significant diff since the ordering of attributes in the xml elements is not deterministic and their order can change (even if the content of the xlsx file stayed the same).

By implementing deterministic ordering of XML attributes, we ensure that regenerating a form XML that has not changed will not result in significant diffs, making version control and form management much easier.
